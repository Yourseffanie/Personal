				<p>It all started when my father got sick, way back 2018 of November 17. Me and my brother were the only one who were taking care of him and our relatives couldn’t care less. We were taken care of and grew up with him. He was like a real father to us.
Yes, he’s not our real father, and my brother were only my step-brother in my mother’s side.
I know, we had a rough upbringing and a lot of conflicts and complicated situations in our family. But still, he is the best dad that we’ve ever had.
that time I thought, “it’s not really the sickness that took my father’s life. It’s the crippling sadness that he went through all those years living with depression. Cause I know, he had a rough relationship with his wife and relatives. I just wish, I could have done a lot better to comfort him and spend more time with him.”
Those thoughts were haunting me still up to this day. And it is also making me sad, to realize that I could have done a lot better. Be a better daughter to him. But those were only left unsaid.
I also remember the times that I stayed up in hospitals to take care of him. I didn’t regret those times, somehow that time, I just want him to get better. To talk more to him.
What I did regret was, if only I were a better daughter, I would be able to finish my schooling. But I didn’t fulfill his last wish. Now that he’s gone, how can I be able to show him that I am trying my best to be a better daughter to him.
Now that me and my brother were left. Where will we be able to live now?
We went from houses to houses trying to live with my mom and other relatives but with no luck, they all treated us badly. I thought that we could depend on them because they were our bloodlines, right?
But I was wrong. Things were only getting worse and worse from it.
“I just wanted to live a normal, happy life.” I thought to myself. “I just wanted to give my brother and siblings a fulfilling life that we deserve. Do we really deserve to live?”
I think it was back then that I also had a depression. It’s a really sudden moment to have someone you live with most of your life be gone in just a matter of seconds. I was devastated, and alone, I sure did have someone special but he also cheated on me so no luck. I am really alone with this situation.
As time goes by, I still have a depression but I keep on just living and fighting for battles I am having a second thought. I’m just afraid that if I die today my life would have amounted to nothing. I am still missing my dad and still talking to him sometimes. About my dreams, my plans for me and my siblings. That I wanted to help them and reunite again even just for an occasion. 
There are times that I just wanted to die, to just end all of this because I’m just tired to feeling this way. Its as if, life is telling me that I don’t deserve any wonderful things in life. Its true that all we’ve gone through were just abused from our own parents, got cheated on by loved ones, and many more harsh things that we didn’t expect they were able to do to us.
Now at present, I am close to graduating at grade 12 that should have been done years ago, if only I graduated back then, I would be on college right now.
I guess, life really messed me up. But sometimes, I am still wondering, what is it that I really want? I am still somehow just existing but not truly living a life.
All the pressure, the stress, problems, crisis.
“I will be able to overcome them. Not immediately, but gradually, step by step, I will do my best to achieve the dream that I want for myself and my siblings.”
I think, that’s the only reason why I am still hanging on. that I know there is still hope and someday, I will be able to fulfill it. I want to witness those moments happening right before my eyes. That someday, I’ll be able to say to myself, “I did it, I finally did it.”
Even though most of the time are just full of crap and shit happenings. It’s really part of life, isn’t it?
Life is really full of challenges and a lot of things can happen at any time.
Looking back to what has happened to me and my brother were a lot of bullshits that we had to live with. But now, a new situation is at hand that we need to deal with.
Sometimes, I am just saying to myself that, “I guess, this is really what we deserve.”
If only blaming will bring something good for us. I would blame all of this to my parents who were living their lives on their respective houses at their comfort.
But those things wouldn’t change a thing at the moment.
The only thing that I have right now is that I control my emotions, my mindset, my decisions, and my actions to be better, and to improve myself to be able to achieve anything that I want to be and have. I am still thankful that those situations and hardships happened to me because it made me stronger now and wiser.
I still have a long journey ahead and I am still improving to be who I want to be.
I know I can do this and I believe in myself.
